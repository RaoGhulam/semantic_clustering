Namaz is an essential part of Islam and includes Farz, Sunnat, Nafl, and Wajib prayers that are offered daily at Fajr, Zuhr, Asar, Maghrib, and Isha times.
Special forms of Namaz such as Friday prayer, Eid prayer, and funeral prayer are performed in congregation and hold great importance in Muslim life.
Muslims also perform additional prayers like Tahajud, Tarawih, Salat-ul-Witr, and Ishraq prayer to gain extra reward and closeness to Allah.
Fasting during the month of Ramadan is Farz and is considered mandatory fasting for every eligible Muslim.
Besides Ramadan, Muslims observe Sunnat fasting, Nafl fasting, and random fasting, including Shaban, Shawwal, and Moharram fasting.
Fasting develops self-control and devotion, and breaking a fast intentionally may require Kaffara according to Islamic teachings.
Zakat is a compulsory act of worship in Islam and includes both Zakat-ul-Maal and Zakat-ul-Fitr, calculated through proper zakat calculation methods.
Zakat wealth may come from bank savings, salary deductions, gold, silver, investments, livestock, and money lent to others.
The distribution of zakat is done among deserving people such as fakir, miskin, amil, gharimin, ibn-us-sabil, and those in fi sabilillah.
Hajj, or pilgrimage, is a major pillar of Islam performed at a fixed pilgrimage time by Muslims who have the ability to travel to Makkah.
The rituals of pilgrimage include staying at Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah, performing tawaf in Masjid al-Haram, and walking between Safa and Marwa.
Important sacred places such as Maqam-e-Ibrahim, Multazim, Hateem, Meezab-e-Rehmat, and Jamarat are visited during Hajj rituals.
